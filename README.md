# Sorting-Visualizer-Using-ReactJS

## Abstract

The project is built using React JS. The application UI would visualize data as a bar using various colours and after selecting a data-ordering (array of random numbers) and algorithm, the user can run an automated animation or step through it at their own pace.
It includes features to select the size of the data (array of random numbers), visualization speed and type of sorting algorithm according to oneâ€™s desire and a dark feature for better understandability. This web-based animation tool is created to visualize various sorting algorithms like: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Shell Sort.
The main aim behind the implementation of this project to make a clear understandability of various algorithms of data structures. Our project provides an effective and efficient knowledge of data structures.
