# Sorting-Visualizer-Using-ReactJS

## Abstract

The project is built using React JS. The application UI would visualize data as a bar using various colours and after selecting a data-ordering (array of random numbers) and algorithm, the user can run an automated animation or step through it at their own pace.
It includes features to select the size of the data (array of random numbers), visualization speed and type of sorting algorithm according to one’s desire and a dark feature for better understandability. This web-based animation tool is created to visualize various sorting algorithms like: Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Shell Sort.
The main aim behind the implementation of this project to make a clear understandability of various algorithms of data structures. Our project provides an effective and efficient knowledge of data structures.

## Proposed Methodology

The flowchart describes the logic of the application. At the beginning of the application the user can select whether to enter the array manually or randomly generate it. If the array is being generated randomly user can select the size and the array is set.
After that the user can select the type of algorithm which needs to be visualized. The type of algorithms offered in the project are Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Instant Sort. To visualize the sorting process, the user can either automatically implement that or manually by clicking the next button for each step.

In the react application context provider is used to make a particular data available to all the components despite how they are nested. The project is divided into two major components, the navigation bar and the other utility functions. The navbar contains options like set array, sorting speed, sorting type, choose algorithm. The utility functions include utilities like generate array, sorting algorithms, etc. Both components together constitute the visualiser.

## Results

This Application will generate a random array. One can manage the size of array and speed of the sorting the elements. There is a drop box in the navigation bar to choose the type of sorting according to one’s desire.

By the end of the project and with numerous iterations a web application visualizing various sorting algorithms is created using ReactJS. In the UI, numerous options are available like choosing the size of the array, type of sorting algorithm, visualization speed, dark mode, information about the chosen algorithm and many more.
